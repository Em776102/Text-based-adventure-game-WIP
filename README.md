Module requirements to run: sys, os, random, time, builtins, json.

URL is the link to the project on online gdb, always contains latest version unless i switch to coding on github or say otherwise.
My code is in the 'Code' branch split into their respective modules(files), may be old so double check URL.
Title is a placeholder.
THIS IS A WIP.
Help, feedback, recommendations, bugs, etc, are highly requested and appreciated.
